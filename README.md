Your project, "Online Turf Booking Algorithm Using Hungarian Technique,"
focuses on creating an efficient and user-friendly turf booking system using the MERN stack
(MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with EJS for the frontend.

Technologies Used

1. Frontend Technologies
React: Dynamic user interface, component-based architecture.
EJS: Renders HTML with dynamic content on the server side.
HTML/CSS: Structure and styling of the web application.
Bootstrap: Responsive design and pre-built UI components.

3. Backend Technologies
Node.js: Server-side runtime for executing JavaScript.
Express.js: Web framework for routing and middleware management.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for user and booking data.
Mongoose: ODM for interacting with MongoDB.

5. Algorithm Implementation
Hungarian Algorithm: Optimizes time slot assignments for turf bookings.

7. Payment Processing
Payment Gateway: (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for secure online payments.

9. Authentication and Security
JWT: User authentication and session management.
bcrypt: Password hashing for enhanced security.
